## Qubit

A [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit) represents a quantum bit which is the basic unit of computation.

A qubit is represented in array notation as [a, b],
where `a^2` is the probability of finding the qubit in 0 state
and `b^2` is the probability of finding the qubit in 1 state.

It can be created initially in 0 or 1 state.

In array notation,

```
0 state: [1, 0]
1 state: [0, 1]
```

When `measure` method is called on a qubit, it collapses into either 0 or 1 based on its internal probability distribution.

## Gates

A qubit can be passed through multiple [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate). All gates must be reversible.

### Not gate

A not gate inverts the state of a qubit.

### Hadamard gate

A [hadamard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Hadamard_(H)_gate) gate puts a qubit into superimposition. A hadamard gate is also reversible. Applying a hadamard gate on an already superimposed qubit will give back the original state of the qubit before superimposition.

In matrix notation, it is equivalent to multiplying the internal state of a qubit by `[[1/√2, 1/√2], [1/√2, -1/√2]]`

Eg:

Passing a 0 state qubit through a hadamard gate and passing the superimposed qubit through the hadamard gate
again to get the initial 0 state:

```
[[1/√2, 1/√2], [1/√2, -1/√2]] * [1, 0] = [1/√2, 1/√2]
[[1/√2, 1/√2], [1/√2, -1/√2]] * [1/√2, 1/√2] = [1, 0]

```

Passing a 1 state qubit through a hadamard gate and passing the superimposed qubit through the hadamard gate
again to get the initial 1 state:

```
[[1/√2, 1/√2], [1/√2, -1/√2]] * [0, 1] = [1/√2, -1/√2]
[[1/√2, 1/√2], [1/√2, -1/√2]] * [1/√2, -1/√2] = [0, 1]

```

### Cnot

A [Cnot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events) - control not, gate works on two qubit - an input and a control qubit.

If the control qubit is 1, it inverts the state of input qubit.
If the control qubit is 0, it preserves the state of input qubit as is.

In matrix notation, a cnot on two qubits `[a0, b0]` and `[a1, b1]` is denoted as,
`[[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0]]
  ✕
 ([a0, b0] ⍟ [a1, b1]`
⍟ : [Tensort product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product) of two matrices

This is also akin to the inversion of input qubit when the control qubit is one.

Notes:

1. This framework only allows cnot to be performed between two non entangled qubits.

2. Also, cnot on a superimposed qubit and a non-superimposed qubit results in entanglement. Currently, this framework does not support entanglement.

Eg:

Cnot between non-superimposed qubits when control input is 0

```
Cnot([1, 0], [1, 0]) = [1, 0], [1, 0]
Cnot([0, 1], [1, 0]) = [0, 1], [1, 0]
```

Cnot between non-superimposed qubits when control input is 1

```
Cnot([1, 0], [0, 1]) = [0, 1], [0, 1]
Cnot([0, 1], [0, 1]) = [1, 0], [0, 1]
```


Cnot between superimposed qubits when control input is 0

```
Cnot([1/√2, 1/√2], [1/√2, 1/√2]) = [1/√2, 1/√2], [1/√2, 1/√2]
Cnot([1/√2, -1/√2], [1/√2, 1/√2]) = [1/√2, -1/√2], [1/√2, 1/√2]
```


Cnot between superimposed qubits when control input is 1

```
Cnot([1/√2, 1/√2], [1/√2, -1/√2]) = [1/√2, -1/√2], [1/√2, -1/√2]
Cnot([1/√2, -1/√2], [1/√2, -1/√2]) = [1/√2, 1/√2], [1/√2, -1/√2]
```
